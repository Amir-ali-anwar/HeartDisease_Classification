 Project Overview

This project tackles the binary classification task of predicting heart disease presence using structured clinical data. It is a continuation of classical ML learning and focuses on implementing best practices for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Objectives

Apply ML pipelines for clean, reusable workflows

Perform robust preprocessing: encoding, imputation, scaling

Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Evaluate performance using confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, F1 score

Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
